# **Web2 Vulnerabilities in Web3 - Labs Repository**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Web2 Vulnerabilities in Web3** repository! This repository aims to explore and demonstrate how vulnerabilities present in traditional Web2 applications can be exploited and have serious consequences in Web3 environments. By leveraging Web2 vulnerabilities like **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** and others, we can analyze how these issues can be carried over to decentralized applications, blockchain, and Web3 technologies.

## **Purpose**

In this project, I am investigating the impact of common Web2 security vulnerabilities on Web3 systems. While Web3 promises greater decentralization and security, many Web2 security flaws still pose significant risks when adapted to the Web3 landscape.

Through various labs, I will demonstrate how Web2 vulnerabilities can be exploited in Web3 scenarios and provide insights into the potential dangers they present. Specifically, I will focus on how these vulnerabilities can compromise the security and integrity of decentralized applications (dApps), blockchain-based systems, and smart contracts.

## **Labs**

The repository contains several labs that demonstrate Web2 vulnerabilities and their effect on Web3 systems. Each lab is self-contained, and you can follow the instructions to replicate the environment and exploit the vulnerability. The labs are numbered as follows:

- **Lab 1:** Demonstrating IDOR vulnerability in a Web3 context (NFT example).
- **Lab 2:** (Include the title and short description of the second lab here).

Each lab is focused on a specific vulnerability, providing step-by-step instructions to exploit the vulnerability in a Web3 environment, and understanding how to mitigate these risks effectively.

## **Why Is This Important?**

As Web3 continues to grow, it's crucial to understand how traditional Web2 vulnerabilities translate into the decentralized ecosystem. Security in the Web3 world is not immune to the same flaws that plagued Web2 applications. This research helps in identifying and addressing these vulnerabilities, ensuring that Web3 applications are as secure as possible, especially as they handle valuable assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs.

By participating in these labs, you will gain a deeper understanding of how Web2 vulnerabilities can affect Web3 platforms and how to secure them against such threats.

## **Repository Structure**

The repository is structured as follows:

- `Lab1/`: The first lab folder, which demonstrates the IDOR vulnerability in Web3.
- `Lab2/`: The second lab folder, which will showcase another Web2 vulnerability in Web3.
- `README.md`: The general repository information (this file).
