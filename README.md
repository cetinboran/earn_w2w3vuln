# **Web2 Vulnerabilities in Web3 - Labs Repository**

## **Introduction**

Welcome to the **Web2 Vulnerabilities in Web3** repository! This repository explores how vulnerabilities present in traditional Web2 applications, such as **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)**, **Race Conditions**, and **SSRF**, can be exploited and have serious consequences in Web3 environments. By demonstrating these vulnerabilities, we aim to understand how these issues persist and affect decentralized applications, blockchain, and Web3 technologies.

## **Purpose**

In this project, we investigate the impact of common Web2 security vulnerabilities on Web3 systems. While Web3 promises greater decentralization and security, many Web2 security flaws still pose significant risks when adapted to the Web3 landscape.

Through various labs, we demonstrate how Web2 vulnerabilities can be exploited in Web3 scenarios and provide insights into the potential dangers they present. Specifically, we focus on how these vulnerabilities can compromise the security and integrity of decentralized applications (dApps), blockchain-based systems, and smart contracts.

## **Labs**

The repository contains several labs that demonstrate Web2 vulnerabilities and their impact on Web3 systems. Each lab is self-contained, allowing you to replicate the environment and exploit the vulnerability. The labs are organized as follows:

- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**

  - **Lab 1:** Demonstrating IDOR vulnerability in a Web3 context (NFT example).
  - **Lab 2:** Further exploration of IDOR in decentralized applications.

- **Race Condition**

  - **Lab 1:** Demonstrating a race condition vulnerability in Web3 environments.

- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)**
  - **Lab 1:** Exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities in Web3 systems.

Each lab focuses on a specific vulnerability, providing step-by-step instructions on how to exploit the vulnerability in a Web3 environment, as well as ways to mitigate the risks effectively.

## **Why Is This Important?**

As Web3 continues to grow, understanding how traditional Web2 vulnerabilities translate into the decentralized ecosystem is crucial. Security in the Web3 world is not immune to the same flaws that plagued Web2 applications. This research helps identify and address these vulnerabilities, ensuring that Web3 applications are as secure as possible, especially when handling valuable assets like cryptocurrencies and NFTs.

By participating in these labs, you will gain a deeper understanding of how Web2 vulnerabilities can affect Web3 platforms and how to secure them against such threats.
